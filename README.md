# AWS-Card-Game

Don't have physical cards to play with friends? No problem.
I built **AWS-Card-Game** - a fully serverless, production-grade, multiplayer card game using approx. 20+ AWS services. I lost count. Maybe you can count. From real-time game state, live health tracking, multiplayer turn logic, in-game chat, automated pipelines, to secured deployments - this is not a side project. This is a cloud-native engineering achievement.

I didn‚Äôt just build a game.
I engineered a real-time, cloud-scalable multiplayer experience - with CI/CD, observability, IAM-tightened security, real-time chat, fault tolerance, and stateful persistence - all in AWS. This is what happens when DevOps meets game logic.

## üßùüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Architecture Breakdown

###  Backend (Fully Serverless)
- **Lambda Functions**: Handle every single action - from `throwCard`, `endGame`, `startGame`, `attackPlayer`, `sendMessage`, etc.
- **API Gateway**: Expose all backend Lambda endpoints as RESTful APIs.
- **DynamoDB**:
  - `games` table: Tracks all live and ended games.
  - `players` table: Stores current player states, health, turns.
  - `gameChatMessages`: Real-time player messages.
- **WebSocket API Gateway**: For future real-time gameplay and live updates.

###  Frontend
- Built in **React** and hosted on **AWS Amplify + S3 Static Hosting**
- Responsive UI with:
  - Game screen with player cards, game logs, scoreboard.
  - Chat section component to talk with other players live.
  - Buttons: attack, throw, heal, end game.

###  CI/CD & Automation
- **CodePipeline** + **CodeBuild**: Push your code and it deploys - frontend, backend, Lambda packages, all automated.
- **CloudFormation**: Infra-as-code, redeploy the whole setup in minutes.

### Monitoring & Logs
- **CloudWatch**: Full visibility into every player move, attack, throwCard.
- Game logic outputs structured logs, ready for log-based dashboards.
- **Athena + QuickSight **: For gameplay analytics and leaderboard insights.

### In-Game Chat Feature
**Extra Magic** - Chat section implemented between players, live and stored via:
- **Lambda**: `sendMessageToGame`, `getMessagesForGame`
- **API Gateway**: REST APIs connected to chat functions
- **DynamoDB Table**: `gameChatMessages` for storing timestamped messages per game
- Clean UI component for players to interact live

##  Final Thought
This isn‚Äôt just a card game. It‚Äôs an entire AWS ecosystem fused with game logic, CI/CD, scalability, and real-time cloud-native magic.

Play it, deploy it, break it, or hire me to build your next one.
